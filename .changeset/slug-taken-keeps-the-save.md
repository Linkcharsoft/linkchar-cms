'@linkcharsoft/cms': patch

A URL another document already uses no longer throws away the rest of the save. When the URL follows the title, the editor gets a free one ("casa-2"); when it was typed by hand, everything else is saved, the field keeps its "already in use" error and the save status says "Saved, except the URL". `saveDocument` returns `adjusted` and `errors` on a `saved` result for these cases.
