'@linkcharsoft/cms': patch
---

A failed build can be retried: the latest publish shows "Retry" when its build failed, for users who can publish. The retry runs the build again over what is already live, in its own `publish_log` row (`retry_of`), and is logged as `site.retry`. New server action `retryPublish`.

To update a project: run `linkchar-cms migrations sync` and `supabase db push` (new migration `20261021000000_publish_retry.sql`), and `linkchar-cms routes` so `src/cms/actions.ts` exports `retryPublish`.
