The publish list names what is missing per language ("Title (English)") and the alt texts missing in another language for the files a document uses, which now keep it out of the publication too. Pending changes carry `missing` (data path, locale and label of each item), `urls` (the document's URL per locale) and `urlChanges` (one per locale whose live URL changes) instead of `redirectPrefix` and `urlChange`.
