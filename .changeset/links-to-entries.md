Links and buttons point to pages and documents of the site. A new link type, `entry`, stores the schema entry, the document id for collections and an optional section anchor (`{ type: 'entry', entry: 'posts', id, anchor }`), so the site resolves it to the right URL in every language and removing the document warns about the link. It is the default type of new links; paths typed by hand stay valid as "Other address" (`type: 'internal'`) and are not translated. In the panel, "Site page" picks the page or searches the collection, and lists the page's sections to land on.
