# @linkcharsoft/cms

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 55c2bf5: Editor panel, theme and texts.
  
  - `@linkcharsoft/cms/panel`: the whole panel from Hologramas: overview, pages and collections, the editor (autosave with merge, conflicts, history, preview, a language selector for translated texts), media library, publishing, trash, account with two-step verification, users, activity, guided tours and the help menu. `@linkcharsoft/cms/panel/routes/*` are route factories that take the project's `cms` instance; `createCmsClient` mounts the panel providers (PrimeReact unstyled with its passthrough, toasts, confirmation, motion).
  - `linkchar-cms routes [--check]` writes the panel wiring under `basePath` (screens, layouts, handlers, `src/cms/actions.ts`), scaffolds the root layout and `src/cms/client.ts` once, and checks the proxy matcher. `cms.proxy` keeps signed-out users on the sign-in screens.
  - Theme: `@linkcharsoft/cms/tailwind` preset with `cms-*` tokens derived from `--cms-primary`, `--cms-sidebar` and `--cms-on-primary` through `color-mix()`, fixed neutrals and states, fonts by variable; `@linkcharsoft/cms/panel/styles.css`.
  - Texts: the panel, statuses, roles, activity and tours in the `es` and `en` catalogs (`panelLocale`), overridable with `messages`; tour ids are neutral (`welcome`, `pages`, `page-editor`…).
  - Config: configurable panel segments (`paths`, Spanish by default), `site: { url, titleTemplate }` and `extensions` (menu items with the project's own screens or links).
  - Project field kinds register their panel input in `createCmsClient({ inputs })`; built-in kinds keep their inputs in the panel, out of the core.
  - Draft Mode handlers (`cms.handlers.draft`, `disableDraft`) for the panel preview; `formatDate` in the site time zone.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Database and publishing.
  
  - `@linkcharsoft/cms/server`: the Supabase queries and actions for documents, versions, trash, media, publishing, users, account and sign-in. Each takes the config and clients through a context; `createCmsServer` binds them to Next (cookies, redirects, revalidation) from the project's own environment. Errors are catalog keys (`errors.*`), never prose.
  - `PublishTarget` with `@linkcharsoft/cms/publish/amplify` (build hook + EventBridge webhook, matching an unknown job only to an open publish of the last 30 minutes, failures stored as `error_code`) and `@linkcharsoft/cms/publish/mock` for local development.
  - `publishTarget` moved from `defineCmsConfig` to `createCmsServer`: the config is imported by the browser and must not carry secrets.
  - Base migration `20261020000000_cms_base.sql` (alt text and caption per locale in `media`) and the generic pgTAP suites, copied into a project with `linkchar-cms migrations sync`.
  - Form validators for sign-in, account and users that return catalog messages, shared by the panel and the server.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First release: the CMS core, extracted from Hologramas.
  
  - `defineCmsConfig` with the project's types registered through `Register`.
  - Field kinds on a registry (`defineField`): one place per kind for its default, validation, references, diff summary, localization and input. Projects add their own; `openingHours` is opt-in.
  - Validation without Yup: issue codes translated by the catalogs, plus per-field `validate` and `component`.
  - Catalogs (`es`, `en`) with `t()` and `Intl.PluralRules`; schema labels accept a text, `{ es, en }` or `msg()`.
  - Localized values: one value per locale for texts, inherited images with per-locale overrides, `resolveContent` for the site and `missingTranslations` for publishing.
